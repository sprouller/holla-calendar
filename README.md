# holla-calendar

My first go at using fullcalendar to create an events calendar in react.
â€‹

## To get started

first step -> npm i (to install all needed packages)
second step -> npm run start (to start the application)

### TODO

[ ] editStatus does not reset once you've clicked in to editing an event. I.e. once you try to edit an event you can no longer create a new event.
[ ] timezones mess up so added events show up one day later than the day you actually add them
